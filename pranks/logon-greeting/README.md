## üìÅ What Gets Created

When you install the prank, the script creates:

1. **Scheduled Task**: `WelcomeMessagePrank` (or your custom name)
   - Triggers on user logon
   - Runs hidden PowerShell window
   - Includes configurable delay

2. **Event Log Source**: `WelcomePrank` 
   - For optional logging (debugging purposes)

## üéµ Voice Selection

The script automatically:
- Detects all installed Windows voices
- Randomly selects a different voice each time
- Falls back gracefully if no voices are available

To see your available voices:
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech
$synth = [System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer]::new()
$synth.GetInstalledVoices() | ForEach-Object { $_.VoiceInfo.Name }
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Script must be run as Administrator"**
- Right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"

**"Execution Policy" errors**
- The script uses `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to avoid policy issues

**No sound/speech**
- Check Windows volume settings
- Test Windows Narrator: `Win+Ctrl+Enter`

**Task not running on logon**
- Check Task Scheduler: `taskschd.msc` ‚Üí Task Scheduler Library
- Verify task exists and is enabled
- Check task history for error details

### Manual Management

**View the scheduled task:**
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "WelcomeMessagePrank" | Format-List
```

**Run task manually:**
```powershell
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "WelcomeMessagePrank"
```

**Check task history:**
- Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`)
- Navigate to your task
- View the "History" tab

## üé® Customization

### Adding Your Own Messages

Edit the arrays in the main script:
```powershell
$sassyMessages = @(
    "Your custom sassy message here",
    "Another witty remark"
)
```

### Changing Voice Settings

Modify the `Speak` function to:
- Set specific voice: `$speechSynthesizer.SelectVoice("Microsoft Zira Desktop")`
- Adjust rate: `$speechSynthesizer.Rate = 2` (range: -10 to 10)
- Adjust volume: `$speechSynthesizer.Volume = 80` (range: 0 to 100)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes
